The other little knick-knacks are great too (financiers are decadent and great to share, and so are the shortbreads).

Period. Their scone ingredients are always surprising but they never miss. The baguette sandwiches on weekends are maybe the best in the area. Their iced mochas are a must try as well (they never give me their recipe).</p>",address:"3928 Irving St, San Francisco, CA 94122",image:"https://res.cloudinary.com/the-infatuation/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/images/MZink-SF-DayMoon-Exterior-05_fzreu9",website:"https://www.instagram.com/daymoonbread/?hl=en",coordinates:[-122.50016784667969,37.762691497802734]},{name:"Juniper",description:"<p>Great new bakery. They\u2019ve even won awards for the best croissant: super crunchy on the outside. Their cubano croissant is something I could eat everyday, and their mochas are great too.
